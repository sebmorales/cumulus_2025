description=`Cumulus constantly monitors the Mexico–US border, not for people but for clouds. It scans the skies for atmospheric bodies crossing the geopolitical line.

A custom computer vision system analyzes NOAA satellite imagery to detect clouds as they drift freely across rivers, deserts, walls, and coastlines, indifferent to the boundaries below. 

Cumulus invites viewers to see and unsee the border, offering a low-earth orbit perspective where divisions dissolve. The project contrasts the fluidity of nature with the fixity of politics, revealing borders as human constructs, invisible from a high perspective yet deeply shaping life on the ground.

The coastlines are traced with fragments of poems by Gloria Anzaldúa. The border is marked by thoughts and questions constantly echoing in our minds.

Cumulus was originally a hardware base object, this version was commissioned by the Singapore Art Museum. Click here to read more of the original project.`
